            I am a software developer with a passion for databases, distributed systems, and open source software!

            <br/>
            I completed my master's in Computational Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University in 2021. I also earned my bachelors in Computer Science and Economics from Wesleyan University in 2017.

            At Carnegie Mellon I was a member of the Parallel Data Lab's database research group which focused on self-driving databases. Prior to starting my master's, I worked for 3 years in industry writing software for large financial institutions including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and J.P. Morgan Chase.
